# MarkdownLink

I created this app because it was not possible to post markdown style links like this [Link to Google](https://www.google.com) in Slack.
If you host this app and configure it for your workspace you will be able to use the following format `<https://www.google.com|Link to Google>`
in messages prefixed with the `/mdl` slash command.
